0x14. C - Bit manipulation
Various Bitwise operators
Bitwise OR (|) operator:Bitwise OR will return 1, if any of the bit in the pair is 1.
If both bits are 0, then the outcome will be 0.

Bitwise AND (&) operator
Bitwise AND (&) operator will take two equal length binary sequence and perform the bitwise AND operation on each pair of bit sequence.

AND operator will return 1, if both bits are 1.

Otherwise it will return 0.

Bitwise XOR operator
Bitwise XOR (^) operator will take two equal length binary sequence and perform bitwise XOR operation on each pair of bit sequence.

XOR operator will return 1, if both bits are different.

If bits are same, it will return 0.

Bitwise Left shift << operator
Bitwise Left shift operator is used to shift the binary sequence to the left side by specified position.

Bitwise Right shift >> operator
Bitwise Right shift operator >> is used to shift the binary sequence to right side by specified position.

Bitwise one's complement operator (~)
Bitwise one's compliment operator will invert the binary bits.
If a bit is 1, it will change it to 0.
If the bit is 0, it will change it to 1.
